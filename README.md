# Hi everyone 
I'm **IÃ±igo Varas** (@inogii) currently studying my MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence @uc3m. Here you will see the projects that I have developed in the past years and I can publicly share. 

## ðŸŽ“ Education:
- UPM - BEng in Telecommunication Technologies and Services
- TUM - MSc Computer Science, MSc in Communications Engineering (Exchange)
- uc3m - MSc Applied Artificial Intelligence

## ðŸ“Œ Projects:
- [Autonomous System Models using BGP Data and GNNs](https://github.com/inogii/bthesis): Performed research in the field of networking, merging the knowledge of BGP Networks â€”the paramount routing protocol in the Internetâ€” with a cutting-edge Machine Learning methodology utilizing Graph Neural Networks. Implemented an innovative approach to derive essential properties of Autonomous Systems, the integral components within BGP Networks, resulting in profound insights into their behavior and interrelationships
- [lacasademickeymouse](https://github.com/inogii/lacasademickeymouse): (first in class) Developed as part of the Machine Learning course at UC3m, the primary goal was to create a model that could predict the price of houses based on these input features. A key component that set our model apart was the exploration of non-linear relations between features in our dataset. 
- [Balto-ai](https://devpost.com/software/balto-ai?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress): Project developed for the TUM-Ai Hackathon (May 2023). The goal of the project was to reduce the language barriers for emigrating workers by automating reporting processes for them. We developed a Telegram bot that could use the employer's and employee's language simultaneously, facilitating the communication between them.
